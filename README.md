A simple program written in C++.
I save it here just to keep my progres somewhere.

## Features
- Light mode only,
- Only window mode so you can have more space on your monitor,
- Cool buttons

## Bonus notes
Right now I want rewrite every previous code and add some GUI, just because it looks cool.
